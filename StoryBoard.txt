Here is the basic storyboard/plot:
----------------------------------

Setting: The Fictional Land of Arkadia

Main Character: Your Name...

Possible plots:
Enter your name player...
Welcome "PlayerName." Beware Hero, you are about to venture into Ancient Land of Arkadia.
Everything goes dark
You wake up in a strange forest. All you can see is an ocean of green. You see 4 prospect that lie ahead you. All you have on you are some plain ragged clothes.

Directions:

South you see the forest grow denser.
North you see what appears to be river.
East you see what looks like a ruins of an old castle.
West you see what looks like the outlines of a small town.

Which direction do you hero? ...

North is the town where you have the ability save your progress and buy/make equipment and materials.
(You can't enter the town without killing the feral imp first)
- Once you kill feral imp it will drop feral imp claws
If you choose to go north there will be a guard guarding the entrance to the town.
Only option is to talk to him...(He says) "Hello Traveller, I'm sorry but I can't let a stranger into the town. Maybe if you come back later with something of value, I just might let you in."

In the town there will be 3 options:
Go to the Tavern
- In the Tavern you can...
Go to the Blacksmith
- In the smithery you can...
Go to the shopkeeper
- In the shop you can...

Random Ideas:
-------------
(For background) You are in the the real world and get sucked into the world of Arkadia.
Some puzzles for you to solve
Cool side quest (a wise old man tells u to guess a number between 1 and 50) If you guess right you get a rare material (that you can use to craft a powerful sword).
